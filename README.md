# webappContactManager

 A web application to manage contacts, customize connections, and visualize its relationships.

## About the Project - What's the idea

I always wanted to manage my contacts based on their connections and relationships. Also, I want to visualize how it looks like and at the same time, being able to pick up insights from it. This project is my attempt to bring that idea to life.

## Web App - How should it looks like

I want a clean WebApp, similar to other options on the market, but with the differential of visualizing the connections.

## Project Plan - How I plan to do it

I plan to develop the project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and D3.js.
I have mainly divided the project into three phases.

1. Initial structure and front-end
2. Contacts connections visualization (D3.js)
3. Google Contacts - API Connection
4. Realese version

### 1. Initial Structure and Front-end

First fase milestones:

[ ] Bootstrap 4 front-end;
[ ] Localhost contacts objects;
[ ] Forms to create and edit contacts;
[ ] Forms to create and edit relationships;

### 2. Contacts connections visualization (D3.js)

Second phase milestones (still to be defined).

### 3. Google Contacts - API Connection

Third phase milestones (still to be defined).

### 4. Release version

Fourth phase milestones (still to be defined).

Every contribution will be welcome, although I don't think anyone would waste their time helping me with this project.
